mingus was started in the summer of 2008 and is currently maintained by two people:

Bart Spaans, who has written most of the modules and is currently writing 
this little text about himself in the third person (awkward). 

And Javier Palanca who has joined the project officially in July, 2009 and 
currently works on adding full MusicXML support in the extra package.
